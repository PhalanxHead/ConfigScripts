# Config Scripts
My repo for my main config files and system setup scripts.

## Usage

### Windows

1. Run `firstTime.bat` as Administrator
2. Set the value for "`repoDir`" in `Startup/setRepoDir.bat` to the current directory (minus `\Startup`)
   This will sync the files back to the correct location.
3. Run `firstCopy.bat` as a normal user (ie just double click on it)



### Linux

Run `sudo firstTime.sh` in your command prompt.
